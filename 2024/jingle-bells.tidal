In TidalCycles, we can create patterns that emulate the structure of a heptagram (a 7-pointed star) by combining rhythmic sequences that overlap and intersect. Below is a code snippet that captures the essence of vertices and overlapping lines in a heptagram-like rhythmic pattern.

-- Define the main heptagram rhythm using 7 vertices
let heptagram = "t*7" -- 7 impulses to represent the vertices

-- Create overlapping lines by rotating the pattern

    sound "sn*7" # n (run 7), -- Snare with 7 unique pitches
    sound "cp*7" # n (run 7) # speed (slow 2 $ sine), -- Clap with modulated speed
    sound "arpy" # n (irand 7) |+| speed "1.5" # cut 2 -- Overlapping arpeggios
